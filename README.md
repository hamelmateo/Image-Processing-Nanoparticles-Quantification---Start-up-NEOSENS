# Image Processing and Nanoparticle Quantification for Effective Biomarker Detection in Sepsis Diagnostics

![NEOSENS Logo](<NEOSENS_Logo.png>)

## Description

This image processing software is designed for nanoparticle identification and quantification, developed in the context of NEOSENS, a startup focused on Neonatal Sepsis diagnostics. Neonatal Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that demands early diagnosis and treatment. Emerging optical biosensing technologies hold promise for accurate biomarker concentration detection, requiring robust image analysis software for single nanoparticle detection.

In this thesis project, various image processing methods for nanoparticle processing and detection have been tested and compared to find the optimal pipeline. The comparison utilized analytical metrics and visual inspection to assess the efficacy of these techniques.

The results demonstrate that processing using Gaussian filters and K-space filters significantly improves image quality. When combined with the right segmentation tool, such as a global fixed threshold, it can achieve a low limit of detection (< 0.05ng/mL) with a short computation time, making it suitable for clinical testing.
